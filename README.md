# Line-And-Wall-Follower-Robot
Line and Wall Follower autonomous robot using Arduino

1. In a maze, the robot can follow a line and keep track of non-terminal paths.
2. By the end of the first run, it will calculate the shortest path.
3. In the second run, it will complete the given maze using the previously calculated shortest path. 
4. The bot has been constructed using QTR-8RC Reflectance Sensor Array, ATmega328- a single chip micro-controller and Arduino Board Uno R3 and programmed in Arduino Software Integrated Development Environment.
